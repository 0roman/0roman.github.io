Welcome to my security diary. After some years in the industry I also decided to start a blog.

In my previous jobs I have worked a lot with non-public customer code. This does not result in much information that I can talk about publicly. However, I sometimes find time to deal with 0-days, N-days and CTFs. If I find the time in the future, I will blog about them.
